# System Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture of the Real-Time Electromagnetic Railgun System, including its functional modules, data/control flows, and hardware-software integration.

##  System Overview

The system consists of five tightly integrated subsystems:

| Subsystem        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Vision Module** | Detects and tracks targets using a camera and OpenCV-based neural network |
| **Servo Control** | Adjusts the aiming angle based on target coordinates |
| **Firing Circuit** | Charges capacitors and releases high-current pulses via relay control |
| **I/O Control** | Reads and writes GPIO for relay switching and power status feedback |
| **UI Interface** | Provides real-time video feed and system status via a Qt GUI |

                                               [IO & Relay Trigger]
                                                     â”‚
                                        [Capacitor Discharge (Fire)]
```

All components are coordinated via real-time callbacks and thread-safe communication queues.

## Hardware Block Diagram
## ðŸ”Œ Hardware Block Diagram

- **Power Supply**: 3Ã—Â 18650 Liâ€‘ion batteries in series (~12Â V nominal)  
- **Stepâ€‘up Circuit**: Boost converter with 15Â ÂµH inductor + flyback diode  
  _(or use a commercial DCâ€“DC boost module rated for â‰¥20Â V, â‰¥5Â A output)_  
- **Control Switches**:  
  - Prototype: manual toggles SW1/SW2  
  - Final: 2â€‘channel relay module driven by Raspberry Pi GPIO  
- **Capacitor**: 1000Â ÂµF electrolytic for energy storage before discharge  
- **Discharge Switch**: Nâ€‘MOSFET or relay to route discharge current into coil  
- **Barrel (Launcher Coil)**:  
  - Copper coil wound around a nonâ€‘conductive plastic tube  
  - Steel ball projectile seated in the tubeâ€™s center  
  - When discharged, the coilâ€™s magnetic pulse propels the ball forward

## Software Threading & Signal Handling
Thread / Task | Description
Vision Thread | Processes camera frames, outputs target positions
Callback Dispatcher | Routes vision output to servo + IO threads
Servo Thread | Converts target position to angle; sends to PCA9685
I/O Thread | Reads safety sensors, controls relay pins
UI Thread | Displays video stream, status indicators, user buttons
---

## Communication Interfaces
Â²C: Used for servo control via PCA9685 module

GPIO: Raspberry Pi controls relay signals (charge/discharge trigger)

Internal Queues: Thread-safe std::queue/Qt signals for module coordination

USB Camera or PiCamera: Frame source for real-time processing

## Notes on Electrical Design

Old Design (see schematic):

Uses MOSFET (VS-70TPS12PBF) for switching

Boost inductor + diode creates charging loop

Two push-button switches (SW1/SW2) manually control flow

New Design:

Replaces manual switches and MOSFET with relay modules

GPIO triggers allow safe, programmable operation

Enhanced with software interlock logic

---

## Summary

The system ensures:

Modular and testable architecture

Real-time control loop (detection â†’ aiming â†’ firing)

Safe hardware operation via callback and interlock logic

Clear power and control signal paths for easy debugging and reproduction
