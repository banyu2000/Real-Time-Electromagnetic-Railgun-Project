# ðŸ§ª Servo Unit Test â€“ PCA9685 PWM Driver

This test verifies the functionality of the servo control system using a PCA9685 PWM driver over I2C on Raspberry Pi 5.

---

##  Purpose

This unit test:
- Initializes the PCA9685 device via I2C
- Continuously sweeps two servo motors across their full angular range (0Â° to 180Â°)
- Uses graceful termination (SIGINT) to reset both servos to 90Â° on exit

##  Build Instructions

### Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi with I2C enabled (`/dev/i2c-1`)
- 2 servo motors connected to PCA9685 (channels 0 and 1)
- CMake & C++17 compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### Compile with CMake:
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make

The output executable will be: servo_test

 ### Run the Test

sudo ./servo_test
The horizontal servo (channel 0) will sweep from 0Â° to 180Â°

The vertical servo (channel 1) will sweep from 180Â° to 0Â°

Press Ctrl+C to stop â€“ the servos will return to 90Â° automatically

### Example console output:
Horizontal: 0Â°   Vertical: 180Â°
Horizontal: 10Â°  Vertical: 170Â°
...
Program terminated. Servos reset.

### Test Outcome Criteria

Metric	Condition
I2C connection	No runtime exception
Angle movement	Smooth servo sweep observed
Exit handling	Servos return to neutral

### Notesï¼š

PCA9685 default I2C address: 0x40

If you're not using /dev/i2c-1, change I2C_DEV in PCA9685.h

Use a dedicated power supply for servos if they draw significant current
